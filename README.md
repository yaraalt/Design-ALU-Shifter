# Design-ALU-Shifter
The aim of this project is to design the 4-bit Function Unit Combining Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and a Shifter that can perform multiple operations as seen in the "Test Cases.pdf" file.

Note:
- Use X and Y as 4 bits input and F as 4 bits output.
- S0, S1, S2, and S3 represent the selection code in the operation set table.
- Three statue bits V (over flow), C (carry), and N (negative) are related to arithmetic operations and statue bit Z (zero) is related to both arithmetic and logic operations.
